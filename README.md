# procstat
displays linux proc stat (/proc/pid/stat) in human-readable format

# summary
Small tool to translate cryptic info from /proc/[pid]/stat
into understandable form. Actually, ps shows most of things
needed. But this will show you everything at once in mostly
raw format.

Read man 5 proc about meaning of fields. 

Without arguments procstat reads stat info from stdin.
